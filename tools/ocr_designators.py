"""
ocr_designators.py — seed component positions by reading the silkscreen.

The board drawing and the schematic sheets both label every part with its
designator, so the label's own bounding box is the position worth recording:
it is where a person looks to find the part, and it comes from the image itself
rather than from anyone's estimate.

Two things make a plain tesseract pass insufficient, and both are handled here:

  * Silkscreen text runs horizontally *and* rotated 90 degrees, roughly half
    and half, so the image is read at both orientations and the boxes from the
    rotated pass are mapped back.
  * Recognition of small isolated tokens is noisy, so every candidate is
    matched against the authoritative designator list from the parts list.
    A token that is not a real designator on this board is discarded, and a
    near miss ('VREL3', 'R2320') is snapped to the designator it can only be.

Output: .build/<asm>/ocr_<space>.json, positions normalised 0..1.

Usage: tools/ocr_designators.py <asm> <space>      space = board | sh1 | sh2 | ...
