fold_bundle.py — land an Author Mode bundle, whole, in one command.

Author Mode's "Export all boards" writes every edited board into one JSON.
This folds it: geometry into each board's overrides, then a rebuild, then the
integrity check, then one summary of what actually changed.

    tools/fold_bundle.py author-exports/a-author-bundle-2026-09-01.json --dry-run
    tools/fold_bundle.py author-exports/a-author-bundle-2026-09-01.json
    tools/fold_bundle.py .../bundle.json --drop-moved --only A3,SYS

It replaces unpack_export.py, which wrote data/<asm>.coords.json and
data/<asm>.js directly. Both of those are generated: build_coords.py rebuilds
the first from the reader plus the overrides, and assemble.py rebuilds the
second from the curated files plus the first. So an export unpacked into them
survived exactly until the next build and then vanished with nothing saying
so. An export folds through the overrides or it does not last, which is why
everything here goes via fold_overrides.py.

Four things this reports that nothing did before, each of them something a
previous fold got wrong or nearly did:

  first-time mappings   designators that had no schematic position at all.
                        This is usually the whole point of a round of work and
                        was previously invisible among the noise.

  nothing real changed  said out loud, per board. A bundle carries every board
                        that was open, and a round trip through JSON turns 1.0
                        into 1 and drifts coordinates by a fraction of a pixel.
                        Six of eight boards in one bundle were entirely that.
                        Without a line saying so, the next person diffs by hand
                        and mistakes formatting for edits.

  stale after a move    a move is an addition and nothing else: an override can
                        add a position and cannot withdraw the reader's own.
                        Move a marker to another sheet and the old one stays,
                        pointing at whatever is still there. One board kept one on a
                        neighbouring part's designator text and it surfaced only
                        because an unrelated marker landed on top of it. (Seen
                        on the project this pipeline was built for.)

  edits coords can't carry
                        Author Mode edits record fields too -- signals, notes,
                        expectations. Those live in the curated files, and
                        assemble.py rebuilds the dataset from those, so a field
                        edited in the editor is discarded at the next assemble.
                        Nothing folds them; they are named here so they can be
                        copied across by hand before they are lost.

Nothing here writes a curated file or re-runs the reader.
