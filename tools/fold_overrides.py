fold_overrides.py -- fold positions drawn in Author Mode back into the
overrides file, so the next build keeps them.

Author Mode exports data/<asm>.coords.json, which is exactly the file
build_coords.py regenerates from the reader plus the overrides. Export it and
rebuild and the work is gone. What survives a rebuild is
data/<asm>.coords.overrides.json -- and that is written in pixels of
.build/<asm>/drawing_full.png, which the browser has never seen: it loads
assets/<asm>/drawing.png, a downscale of it. Converting by hand means knowing
both sizes and getting the factor right for every box.

So this does it: read the export, keep only the entries that actually differ
from the built file, convert them to the pixels the overrides are measured in,
and merge them in without disturbing anything else in there.

    tools/fold_overrides.py a3 ~/Downloads/a3.coords.json
    tools/fold_overrides.py a3 ~/Downloads/a3.coords.json --dry-run

Board and schematic positions both. The two live in different places and are
measured in different pixels: board boxes go under "board" in pixels of
drawing_full.png, schematic boxes under "schematic": {"sh1": {...}} in pixels
of that sheet's own image, which is a different size per sheet.

The overrides take one hand position per designator per sheet, so a part drawn
twice on the same sheet cannot be expressed. Quietly keeping the first of the
two would be worse than saying so, and this refuses to fold that designator and
names it instead.
