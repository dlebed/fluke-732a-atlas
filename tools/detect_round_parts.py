detect_part_bodies.py — find the outline a part is drawn as, and propose its
marker geometry.

PROTOTYPE / authoring aid. This does not run as part of the build: the
full-resolution drawing it reads is a build intermediate and is not versioned,
so nothing in data/ may depend on it. It writes a proposal you paste into
data/<asm>.coords.overrides.json after looking at the pictures.

How it works
------------
The locator art letters a designator *inside* the part it names. So the reader
has already handed us a seed point inside the outline: the label box. From that
seed we cast rays outward, take the first ink each ray meets, and fit a shape to
the hits. Rays that hit something else -- a lead, a neighbouring part, the
lettering itself -- are outliers and are trimmed. A part whose surviving rays do
not agree on a shape is reported as "no confident fit" rather than guessed at,
because a marker in the wrong place is worse than a marker of the wrong shape.

Two shapes are fitted to the same hits and the better-supported one wins:

  circle   hits at a constant radius        -- cans, radial fuses, TO cans
  rect     hits on four straight lines      -- bridges, diodes, relays, DIPs

They are told apart by how well each explains the same evidence, so a fit is
only claimed when one hypothesis clearly beats the other and clears the
agreement floor on its own. Everything else is declined.

Three details of the artwork the fitter has to know about:

  * The lettering has to go before the rays are cast, or the rays stop on it.
    It is erased by connected component: ink components that lie wholly inside
    a box around the designator and are small enough to be a glyph are removed.
    An outline crossing that box is a large component and survives. Blanking a
    rectangle instead was tried first and is worse -- the label box is padded
    and sometimes wider than the part, so it blanks the very edge being looked
    for (CR3's left edge is 35 px from its label centre, inside a 52 px blank).

  * A diode or bridge is drawn with a solid polarity band across one end. A ray
    into it stops on the band's inner edge, several tens of pixels short of the
    outline, and the marker comes out short and off-centre. So a first hit that
    is *thicker than an outline stroke can be at that incidence* is treated as
    a filled region rather than an edge: the ray steps over it and takes the
    next stroke behind, if one is close enough to be the same part's edge.

  * Parts that touch let a ray through the tangent point and on into the
    neighbour, which is how F3/F5/F7 escaped: a ray leaving one fuse crossed
    the next one entirely and stopped on its far side, at r=239 where the truth
    is 86. Each hypothesis therefore bounds its own search: rays are re-cast
    with a ceiling set from the current estimate, so a ray that would have to
    run 1.7x further than its neighbours to find ink finds nothing instead.

Which parts to try comes from the parts list, which says what a part *is*
without saying anything about where it is: CAP,AL and CAP,TA are cans,
FUSE,...RADIAL is a cylinder, DIODE,...,BRIDGE and RELAY and IC,...DIP are
boxes. That classification is free and exact; it is the geometry that has to be
measured. --all ignores the list and tries everything with a placement, which
is how the reach of the method was measured rather than assumed.

The thresholds below were measured on the 400 dpi machine-drawn locator art
this method was developed on. The 732A drawings are 600 dpi and hand-lettered,
so expect to re-measure MIN_R and the SEED_INSIDE figures against a few parts
whose outline is known before trusting a run.

      * A label box padded wider than the part is safe. CR3's left edge is
        35 px from its label centre, inside the box, but that stroke runs the
        full 383 px height of the part, so it stays while the lettering goes.
      * Lettering that touches the outline is still removed. CR15's "1" runs
        into the left edge of the part; by component they are one object and
        neither can be erased without the other, but by run length the 36 px
        bar is lettering and the 448 px stroke it touches is not.
      * A polarity band is a long run across the part and stays, which is what
        lets the caster recognise it as a band rather than an edge.

    Blanking the box outright was the first approach and is worse: it hides
