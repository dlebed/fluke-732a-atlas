/*
 * caps.js — the capacitor voltage-derating audit.
 *
 * The 5700A this audit was written for is known for tantalums failing short,
 * and the same margin question applies to any Fluke of the period. The reason is
 * margin: Fluke fitted parts whose rated voltage sits close to the rail they
 * are on, and a solid tantalum run near its rating fails at a rate that only
 * derating fixes. MIL-HDBK-217 asks for 50% derating on solid tantalum; the
 * manufacturers agree on the same rule of thumb, and at 50% the predicted
 * failure rate drops about tenfold and MTTF goes from a few years to over a
 * hundred. So "applied over rated" is the number that matters, and this
 * computes it for every capacitor on the board.
 *
 * Two things it needs and cannot work out for itself:
 *
 *   rated voltage   read from the parts list, which states it for every
 *                   capacitor -- "CAP,TA,4.7UF,+-20%,25V".
 *   applied voltage which rail the part actually sits on. That is a schematic
 *                   question, curated per board into data/<asm>.caps.json,
 *                   and honestly marked as read-from-schematic or inferred.
 *
 * Either can be wrong -- a misread rating, a rail traced to the wrong net --
 * so both are editable in Author Mode and the override is kept beside the
 * dataset rather than in it.
 *
 * Ratio alone does not rank the risk, though. What a failing tantalum does
 * depends on what is behind it: a short across an unfused rail with a 6600 uF
 * reservoir behind a 3 A regulator is a fire, and the same short on a fused
 * 0.5 A rail blows the fuse. That is the rail class, and it belongs in the
 * ranking next to the margin.

   *     ESR = DF / (2 * pi * f * C)      with f = 120 Hz, the standard
   *
   * so the limit is a function of capacitance, and a big can is allowed far
   * less ESR than a small one. That is why "4 ohms" means nothing until you
   * know whether the part is 1 uF or 100 uF.
   *
   * The tantalum bands are AVX's own, from the TAP datasheet -- the series the
   * replacements will come from. The aluminium bands are a general-purpose
   * radial rule rather than one part's datasheet, because the originals here
   * are thirty-year-old parts from several makers and no single datasheet
   * covers them; they are marked as such so nobody mistakes them for a spec.

   * Aluminium tan δ, from a general-purpose radial datasheet (Nichicon VX),
   * measured at 120 Hz and 20 °C.
   *
   * This is a gross upper limit, not a precise figure, and it does not need to
   * be precise: the parts on these boards are thirty years old, from makers
   * whose datasheets are long gone, and the question being asked is "is this
   * one obviously finished" rather than "does it still meet its original spec".
   *
   * The table is not monotonic, and that is the whole point. tan δ falls as the
   * rating rises to 63-100 V, then jumps back up for high-voltage parts, which
   * use much thicker foil and a different electrolyte. So a 1 uF 400 V part is
   * allowed about 330 ohms brand new, while a 1000 uF 16 V part is allowed a
   * fifth of an ohm -- the same 20 ohm reading is healthy on the first and
   * means the second is long dead. No single "low ESR is good" threshold can
   * say that; only a bound that depends on capacitance and rating together can.
   *
   * The numbers are the loosest of the common series, on purpose. tan δ varies
   * enormously between series for the same value and rating -- a physically
   * large general-purpose part (Nichicon VX) is specified at 0.10 for 50 V,
   * while a miniature one (Rubycon YXM) is allowed 0.19 for the same 22 uF
   * 50 V, because a smaller can has less foil and shorter windings. Using the
   * tighter figure would fail a brand-new miniature part, which is the one
   * mistake this must not make: a bound that condemns good parts is worse than
   * no bound at all. So the table takes the permissive end, and a reading past
   * it is dead under any series anyone would have fitted.
   *
   * A modern low-ESR replacement will sit far under these numbers. That is
   * expected and is not a fault: the bound catches parts that have dried out,
   * and being well inside it is what a healthy part of any series looks like.
