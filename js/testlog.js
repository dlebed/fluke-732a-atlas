/*
 * testlog.js — measurement sessions, repairs, scoring and export.
 *
 * A session is one visit to one board of one instrument: who measured it,
 * when, on which meter, every reading taken and every part touched. Sessions
 * are kept so that the same test point can be compared across visits -- a
 * supply that has been sliding from +565 V to +520 V over three years is still
 * "in tolerance" every single time, and only the history shows the problem.
 *
 * Everything here hangs off a unit, meaning one physical instrument with one
 * serial number. That is not bookkeeping: two 732As on the same bench have
 * different histories, and a record that cannot say which instrument it
 * describes is not a service record.
 *
 * Three kinds of thing get recorded:
 *
 *   readings   what a test point measured, scored against the manual
 *   readings   what a component measured, scored against the parts list where
 *              the parts list states a value -- same list, because they are
 *              the same act and belong on one timeline
 *   repairs    what was found faulty and what went in its place
 *
 * Storage is localStorage plus explicit export, because a file:// page cannot
 * rely on storage surviving, and because a service record belongs in a file
 * next to the manuals rather than inside a browser profile.
