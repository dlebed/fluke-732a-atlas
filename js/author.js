 * author.js — the editor behind ?author=1.
 *
 * Everything the dataset holds about an item is editable here: where it sits on
 * the board, where it sits on each schematic sheet, and every field on the
 * record including the per-mode expectations of a +/-PA test point. Edits
 * mutate the loaded dataset and are mirrored to localStorage continuously, so
 * closing the tab loses nothing; "Export" writes the files back out.
 *
 * Two exports, because the two halves have different owners:
 *   data/<asm>.coords.json  geometry -- regenerated freely, safe to overwrite
 *   data/<asm>.js           the whole dataset, when metadata was edited too
 *
 * Every edit is undoable. A marker dragged off the edge of the board is
 * otherwise unreachable -- there is nothing left to click -- so an editor that
 * can move things has to be able to move them back.

   * gives you to aim at. A rectangular part shows its own corners, so a box is
   * drawn corner to corner. A round part shows only its rim -- nothing marks
   * the centre of a can -- so a circle is drawn rim to rim across the middle,
   * the drag being a diameter rather than the diagonal of a bounding box.
   * Taking those same two rim points as box corners would put them at √2 times
   * the radius and draw a circle about 30% too small.
