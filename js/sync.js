/*
 * sync.js — linked views: one leader window, any number of followers.
 *
 * The leader is the ordinary app; a follower is the same page opened with
 * ?follow=<id>, showing only the stage and applying the leader's navigation
 * — assembly, selection, highlights — while keeping its own zoom, pan,
 * display and sheet. State crosses windows through one localStorage key per
 * link. Followers poll it, because the storage event is not guaranteed to
 * fire between file:// windows in every browser; where it does fire it only
 * makes the poll's answer arrive sooner. The event never fires in the
 * window that wrote, and the leader reads the key only once at init to seed
 * its sequence counter and never applies what it finds, so there is no echo
 * path to guard against.
